# Appointment Scheduling App

## Overview

This project is a tool developed during my internship for a bathroom remodeling company. The app efficiently assigns in-home appointments to sales representatives based on the following factors:

1. **Availability**: Ensures representatives are scheduled only during their working hours.
2. **Product Scope**: Matches appointments to sales reps with relevant expertise.
3. **Proximity**: Minimizes drive time between locations.

## Features

- **Automated Scheduling**: Assigns appointments based on rep availability, expertise, and location.
- **Route Optimization**: Reduces travel time by assigning reps to appointments closest to their current location.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface suitable for employees without technical expertise.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (with libraries for scheduling and optimization)
- **Frontend**: Tkinter (GUI for user interaction)
- **Data Management**: SQLite for database storage of sales reps, appointments, and schedules
